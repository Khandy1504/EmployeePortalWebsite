# EmployeePortalWebsite
 This is a website login system that stores an employee's information in a small database. The employee can login with their password, change information in their profile, register for an account, or logout. There is a user friendly toolbar implemented to help the user navigate through all functions. 

 This project taught me how to write code with php, html, how to connect to a phpmyadmin database. I learned how to use XAMPP as a local host for a private website. The database information population also taught me SQL methods and how to start and destroy a user session for security.
